    <h1>About TerpBale</h1>
    <p>
      TerpBale was born out of the need for a single, clear view of all campus happenings—
      whether you’re into clubs, career events, guest lectures, or concerts. Instead of 
      bouncing between multiple sites and calendar invites, TerpBale aggregates events
      by category, date, and location, and lets you RSVP in two clicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the scenes, we use Supabase to store event data and RSVPs. Our minimalist 
      interface ensures fast load times and a distraction-free browsing experience,
      whether you’re on your phone between classes or on your laptop planning the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the near future, we plan to add user profiles, event filtering by interest,
      and calendar-sync functionality—stay tuned!
